This is an Atari 8-bit game.

# How to build?
You need the MADS assembler. Get it here: http://mads.atari8.info/

Clone the repository, create the `build` folder inside and execute the following command: `build.cmd`

You'll see the `main.xex` file being generated:
```
Writing listing file...
Writing object file...
9671 lines of source assembled in 4 pass
829270 bytes written to the object file
```

# How to play?
Load the `main.xex` file into your Atari. Please not that you need 1MiB of extended memory on board. This game is heavy!

Or use the great `Altirra` emulator: http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html
